Enum for how the graph handles context switches,

NONE: First valid edge is taken only
      and the process does not change
SINGLE: Is the same as NONE 
        but only one vertex may be selected as start
SWITCH: All valid edges are taken. 
        A process per vertex is spawned and
        previous process is killed.
SWITCH_UNSAGE: Same as SWITCH but will pass edge->b_vars to edge->f
